# Perceptron

This is a perceptron implementation in ruby, the perceptron classifies 2
dimensional linear functions.  

It's written in a gem structure however it's not available on rubygems.

## Installation

$ git clone https://github.com/skylerto/perceptron.git
$ cd perceptron
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To use this rub `bin/console` to pop an interactive prompt where you can train
the perceptron with the default data or your own data.  

To train a perceptron run `Perceptron.train xyz` where xyz is the path to the
file, or if no file is given it trains it with the data from `data/x_train.txt`. For a
specification of what a training file should look like please output the look at
[input guidelines](doc/input_guidelines.md).  

To classify a specific coordinate using your trained perceptron, run
`Perceptron.classify x, y` where x is the desired x coordinate and y is the
desired y coordinate in the classification.
